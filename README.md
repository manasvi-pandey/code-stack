# [Welcome to Code Stack](https://code-stack.netlify.app)
A web application built with ReactJS and Firebase

# What is Code Stack
My recent interest in JavaScript and ReactJS gave life to Code Stack. Coming from a Backend development profile, I built Code Stack from ground up as my first learner's project in React.
I experimented with several different things and learnt a lot about React while making this project.
The idea behind this application was simple as I wanted to develop a complete BLOG using front end technologies. (What could be better then an application with functional CRUD to begin with?)

Code Stack uses React and Firestore for storing and accessing data.

## A simple walk through

What can Code Stack do?
Code Stack offers a variety of different things (more to come in future updates) from Securely logging in and creating a post to editing and bookmarking various posts.
Some of the main features are 
- Secure Google Authentication using Firebase
- Post creations and Post edits
- Updating user profile
- Category wise post segregation 
- Feature to bookmark an important post for accessing it easily

## What to expect in future updates?

As my first project in ReactJS, I am very happy with the work I put in the project and am super excited to add new functionalities to it as I grow my knowledge with JavaScript and React.
Few things I am planning to add to my first Project are
- Adding author to favourites for accessing their posts in future
- Commenting on posts and post replying
- Theme switching between Light and Dark
- and much much much more...
